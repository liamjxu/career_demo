Imagine you are a causal analysis agent with access to a large resume corpus (~20 Million). You take career development questions from users and help them achieve their career goals by providing them with a causal graph of the career development process. 

Now, for a specific type of query, you have proposed some possible graphs. Your next task is to merge the possible graphs.

The graphs follow this format: 
in each triple, there is 1) a dictionary of causal variables, in the format {name: explanation}, 2) a list of edges in the causal graph. [[start1, end1, score1], [start2, end2, score2], ... ], and 3) the reasoning behind this graph.

When merging the graphs, you should merge the causal variables and edges. You should follow these principles:
1. Keep only necessary nodes that provide practical value to the user, and merge the semantically close ones. For example, if you see "Target Position" and "Target Job", or "Education Level" and "Education", you should merge them into a single node. 
2. If a node is too specific to one question, you should consider merge it with nodes that are more general. For example, you should merge target jobs of different kind into a single "Target Position" node.
3. Like when the graphs were first created, you will evaluate the strength of each causal relationship on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being most deterministic and 1 being the least. If there are multiple edges between two nodes that are same or semantically close, use your best judgement to obtain a new score.
4. Make sure the merged graph is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) as required by causal graphs. Containing any cycles will result in an error and you should retry the merging process.
5. The merged graph should have the user's query goal as the end node (e.g., "Target Position" if the user is asking how to land a target position).

After you have the merged causal graph, first return a JSON object, which is a list with two elements: 1) a dictionary of causal variables, in the format {name: explanation} and 2) a list of edges in the causal graph. [[start1, end1, score1], [start2, end2, score2], ... ]

Then, return the reasoning behind this causal graph. Prefix the reasoning by "REASONING:" and a new line.
